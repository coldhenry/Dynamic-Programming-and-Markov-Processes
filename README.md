# Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes
- In this paper, we aims to design an algorithm that generate an optimal path for a given Key and Door environment. There are five objects on a map: the agent (the start point), the key, the door, the treasure (the goal), and walls. The agent has three regular actions, move forward (MF), turn left (TL), and turn right (TR), and two special actions, pick up key (PK) and unlock door (UD). Taking any of these Ô¨Åve actions costs energy (positive cost).
- This type of problems could be considered as a Markov Decision Process, which could be applied to other applications in robotics. For example, a mail robot which delivers mails and packages in a building could take advantage of this algorithm to find the optimal path to a particular location. Meanwhile, an autonomous-driving vehicle could use the algorithm to calculate its best path from 2 locations.
- To solve this problem, the high level approach is to assign different cost to each actions given various scenarios. Same movement could result in different cost while encountering a wall or a key. We start from the very end of the path, calculate its cost, and propagate the cost to the beginning. By doing so, the dynamic programming algorithm ensures us a path that get the agent to the treasure location with a minimal cost.
